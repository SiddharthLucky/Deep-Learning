Generative adverseria neural netowrk:

This contains 2 main parts which include which include 
1. A Generator
2. A Discriminator

Overview of the work

The Generator: The generator creates a random fake image and attaches it along with the real images that go into the dicriminator.
this is done by adding a random noise to the image that the generator generates.

The Discriminator: This tries to differentiate all the images that have been fed to it. which includes even the fake image
that is generated by the generator.
